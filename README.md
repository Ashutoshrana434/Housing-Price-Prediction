#  Housing Price Prediction (Regression ML Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts **California housing prices** using Machine Learning regression models.  
It demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction export.  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (Pipelines, ColumnTransformer, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
- Joblib (model persistence)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for EDA & visualization)  

## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/` → Raw dataset and sample input/output CSVs  
- `notebooks/` → EDA & model training notebooks  
- `models/` → Saved trained models
